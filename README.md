# [ImageJ2](https://imagej.net/) + [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) integration layer

This component is a library which can translate between ImageJ2 and OpenCV's Mat and MatVector,

thus allowing one to take advantage of [Bytedeco's](http://bytedeco.org/) Java-OpenCV [bindings](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/opencv)

For usage examples see the tests.
